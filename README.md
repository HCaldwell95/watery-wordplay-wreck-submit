# Watery Wordplay Wreck

Welcome to my third milestone project, Watery Wordplay Wreck.

Watery Wordplay Wreck is a word-guessing game built with Python. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)" target="_blank">Hangman</a> inspired game in the style of a sinking ship to represent the progress of the game.

The user can choose the number of lives per game to set the difficulty. Through the process of making guesses, either letter by letter or by attempting to guess the entire word, the user endeavors to identify the correct word before the ship succumbs to the depths of the sea. With each unsuccessful attempt, the user loses a life, resulting in the gradual sinking of the ship.

The primary objective of this project is to showcase my comprehension and application of the Python modules I have studied thus far. By integrating them into a real-world project, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in design and development. This terminal application, constructed using a template provided by <a href="https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/p3-template" target="_blank">Code Institute</a> along with my Python code, serves as a tangible representation of my acquired skills.

I appreciate you taking the time to explore my project, and I sincerely hope you find as much enjoyment in it as I did during the design and development phases.

<em>Note: While developing this project, I recognised shortcomings in my demonstration of version control. To address this, I have reconstructed the repository, ensuring proper version control practices are now in place.
